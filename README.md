## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the **MCP Code Mode** project! This application allows you to execute Python code safely while leveraging the power of AI. Follow the steps below to download and run the application.

### 1. 💻 Installation

To get started, you’ll need to set up your environment. This application requires Python 3.11 or higher and Node.js 20 or higher.

#### Step-by-Step Installation:
1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Required Python Packages:**
   Next, use this command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

3. **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
   To ensure you have the latest packages for reference servers, run:
   ```bash
   npm install -g npm@latest
   ```

### 2. 🛠️ Configuration

Now that you have installed the application, it’s time to configure it.

#### Copy the Example Environment Settings:
To get started quickly, duplicate the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Configure Your MCP Servers:
Edit the `mcp_servers.json` file. You will need to specify your MCP servers. Here’s an example of what it might look like:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/your-working-folder"],
      "description": "Local file system server"
    }
  }
}
```
Replace `"/your-working-folder"` with the path to your working folder.
